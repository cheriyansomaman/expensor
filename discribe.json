I want to create a web application for expense tracking. My application name is Expensor.
I want 3 sessions,
1. a form to add expense name, amount in pound sterling, date(optional), and note(opttional). On addition, a success message should display.
2. a table consist of all expense in current month. There must be an option to change month and respective expense should render. It should have edit and delete option.
3. Last session must contain a bar chart of last 5 month, monthly expense, and allow to drill down to weekly and daily expense. also allow to change month range.

All thress session must be shown below as menu and it must be responsive for mobile. 
add configs to add to home screen in iphone and android mobiles using below configs.
{
    "name": "Expense Tracker",
    "short_name": "Expenses",
    "start_url": "./",
    "display": "standalone",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "theme_color": "#3B82F6",
    "icons": [
      {
        "src": "icons/icon-192.png",
        "sizes": "192x192",
        "type": "image/png"
      },
      {
        "src": "icons/icon-512.png",
        "sizes": "512x512",
        "type": "image/png"
      }
    ]
  }
  

I have below firebase configs. use them to add this into `item` collection.
// config.js
window.FIREBASE_CONFIG = {
  apiKey: "$API_KEY",
  authDomain: "$AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "$PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "$STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "$MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "$APP_ID",
  measurementId: "$MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

Use only html, js and css. Use meterial ui for styling.

create index.html, script.js and style.css files.
